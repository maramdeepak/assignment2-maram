## Smithsonian National Museum of American History

The **Smithsonian National Museum of American History** tells the story of the US since settlers arrived from Europe, with exhibitions covering the **social, political, scientific, cultural and military history** of the country. The exhibitions give an interesting look at the building of a nation and how this changed the world at large during its comparatively short history.
