## Smithsonian National Museum of American History

The **Smithsonian National Museum of American History** tells the story of the US since settlers arrived from Europe, with exhibitions covering the **social, political, scientific, cultural and military history** of the country. The exhibitions give an interesting look at the building of a nation and how this changed the world at large during its comparatively short history.

> I've seen many tutorials online that says you need to check $_SERVER['HTTPS'] if the server is connection is secured with HTTPS. My problem is that on some of the servers I use, $_SERVER['HTTPS'] is an undefined variable that results in an error. Is there another variable I can check that should always be defined?

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1175096/how-to-find-out-if-youre-using-https-without-serverhttps>

```
if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] !== 'off'
    || $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] == 443) {
  // HTTPS
} else {
  // HTTP
}
```
